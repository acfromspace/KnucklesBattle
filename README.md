[*knuckles battle*](https://acfromspace.itch.io/knucklesbattle) is a video game with the following features:

- **Premise.** You and your friends come out of a jar of pickles as Pickle Rick in order to defend a tower being invaded by the Knuckles Tribe.

- **Design Idea.** Create a game implementing our own graphics, networking, UI/UX, and artificial intelligence behaviors.

- **Future endeavors.** Diversity amongst stages especially power ups, certain specifics, as well as weird oddities.
