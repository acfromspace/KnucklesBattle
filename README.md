# Knuckles Battle

> They know the way, but you're in the way.

The incoming enemies are coming, otherwise known as the Knuckle clan. You and friends take up the role as Pickle Rick to protect the tower of destiny. Will you survive to level 20? or perish with all the other pickles? Find out yourself.

## Instructions

- 2+ players required.
- One person must "host", provide IP address for their friends, join and ready in the lobby.
- "WASD" to move, mouse left-click to fire a missile.
- Collect power-ups and touch the tower to replenish ammo.
- If either you, your friends, or the tower dies, it is game over!
